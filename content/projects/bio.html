<h2>Nereid Kwok Short Biography</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is <strong>Nereid</strong>. I am a Master of Analytics and Management student at London Business School.</p>
<p>I am from Hong Kong where I got my bachelor degree in Quantitative Finance.</p>
<p>Over my undergraduate studies, I have interned at several financial services companies, NGOs, and investment banks.</p>
<p>After graduation I worked at Goldman Sachs for a year in the Finance division before my studies at LBS.</p>
<p>I only had intermediate knowledge on programming in R, VBA, Python, and SQL. I wish to learn more on analytics through the MAM program.</p>
<p>Here are some of my hobbies that I enjoy during my leisure time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water sports over the summer (canoeing, snorkeling)</li>
<li>Hiking around fall and spring</li>
<li>Playing Sudoku if I am absolutely bored</li>
<li>Explore all kinds of food</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of my best dessert finds in Hong Kong: <img src="https://magazine.foodpanda.hk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/Shari-Shari-Kakigori.jpg" alt="Shari Shari Kakigori" /></p>

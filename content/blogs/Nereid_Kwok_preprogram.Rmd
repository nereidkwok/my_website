## Nereid Kwok Short Biography

Hello, My name is **Nereid**.

I am from Hong Kong where I got my bachelor degree in Quantitative Finance.
Over my undergraduate studies, I have interned at several financial services companies, NGOs, and investment banks.
After graduation I worked at Goldman Sachs for a year in the Finance division before my studies at LBS.I only had intermediate knowledge on programming in R, VBA, Python, and SQL.
I wish to learn more on analytics through the MAM program.

Here are some of my hobbies that I enjoy during my leisure time:

-   Water sports over the summer (canoeing,snorkeling)
-   Hiking around fall and spring
-   Playing Sudoku if I am absolutely bored
-   Trying new kinds of food

This is one of my best dessert finds in Hong Kong: ![Shari Shari Kakigori](https://magazine.foodpanda.hk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/Shari-Shari-Kakigori.jpg)

# Task 2: `gapminder` country comparison

You have seen the `gapminder` dataset that has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007.
To get a glimpse of the dataframe, namely to see the variable names, variable types, etc., we use the `glimpse` function.
We also want to have a look at the first 20 rows of data.

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```

Your task is to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the `country` and the `continent` you come from.

I have created the `country_data` and `continent_data` with the code below.

```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "Hong Kong, China") 

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Asia")
```

First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for the single country you chose.
Map `year` on the x-axis, and `lifeExp` on the y-axis.
You should also use `geom_point()` to see the actual data points and `geom_smooth(se = FALSE)` to plot the underlying trendlines.
You need to remove the comments **\#** from the lines below for your code to run.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
   NULL 

 plot1
```

Next we need to add a title.
Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the `labs()` function to add an informative title to the plot.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}
plot1<- plot1 +
   labs(title = "Life Expectancy Over Time for Hong Kong",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
   NULL


 plot1
```

Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in the *continent* you come from.
(Hint: map the `country` variable to the colour aesthetic. You also want to map `country` to the `group` aesthetic, so all points for each country are grouped together).

```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour= country , group = country))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   NULL
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent.
We will remove all legends, adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` in the end of our ggplot.

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp  , colour= continent ))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   facet_wrap(~continent) +
   theme(legend.position="none") + #remove all legends
   NULL
```

Given these trends, what can you say about life expectancy since 1952?
Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph.
Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> Type your answer after this blockquote.

The life expectancy across all continents increased over time since 1952.
The medical breakthroughs and increased in quality of life has driven the rise of life expectancy globally.
Life expectancy from countries of Americans and countries of Europe converges within their continent.
The growth rate in quality of life and medical progression of the countries has been mutual among the countries, hence minimizing the difference in llife expectancy compared to other continents.
While for most countries in Asia are observed with increased life expectancy, few countries experienced fall behinds in expectency in recent years.
This might suggest the drastic difference in growth rate in quality of life and medical progression between the countries.
Same goes for Africa, where the distribution of life expectancy diverses among countries, suggesting the widening of growth in quality of life and medical progression between the countries.

# Task 3: Brexit vote analysis

We will have a look at the results of the 2016 Brexit vote in the UK.
First we read the data using `read_csv()` and have a quick glimpse at the data

```{r load_brexit_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
brexit_results <- read_csv(here::here("data","brexit_results.csv"))


glimpse(brexit_results)
```

The data comes from [Elliott Morris](https://www.thecrosstab.com/), who cleaned it and made it available through his [DataCamp class on analysing election and polling data in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r).

Our main outcome variable (or y) is `leave_share`, which is the percent of votes cast in favour of Brexit, or leaving the EU.
Each row is a UK [parliament constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Parliament_constituencies).

To get a sense of the spread, or distribution, of the data, we can plot a histogram, a density plot, and the empirical cumulative distribution function of the leave % in all constituencies.

```{r brexit_histogram, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# histogram
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.5) +
  labs(title = "Votes in Favour of Brexit", subtitle = "Histogram",
       x = "% Vote in favour of Brexit") +
  NULL

# density plot-- think smoothed histogram
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_density()+
  labs(title = "Votes in Favour of Brexit", subtitle = "Density Plot",
       x = "% Vote in favour of Brexit") +
  NULL


# The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) 
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  labs(title = "Votes in Favour of Brexit", 
       subtitle = "Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function",
       x = "% Vote in favour of Brexit", y = "ECDF") +
  NULL
  


```

One common explanation for the Brexit outcome was fear of immigration and opposition to the EU's more open border policy.
We can check the relationship (or correlation) between the proportion of native born residents (`born_in_uk`) in a constituency and its `leave_share`.
To do this, let us get the correlation between the two variables

```{r brexit_immigration_correlation}
brexit_results %>% 
  select(leave_share, born_in_uk) %>% 
  cor()
```

The correlation is almost 0.5, which shows that the two variables are positively correlated.

We can also create a scatterplot between these two variables using `geom_point`.
We also add the best fit line, using `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`.

```{r brexit_immigration_plot}
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = born_in_uk, y = leave_share)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  
  # add a smoothing line, and use method="lm" to get the best straight-line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  
  # use a white background and frame the plot with a black box
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Votes in Favour of Brexit of Native Born Residents",
       x = "% Native Born Residents", y = "% Vote in favour of Brexit") +
    NULL
```

You have the code for the plots, I would like you to revisit all of them and use the `labs()` function to add an informative title, subtitle, and axes titles to all plots.

What can you say about the relationship shown above?
Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph.
Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> Type your answer after, and outside, this blockquote.

Native born UK residents are more likely to vote in favour of Brexit.
This might be due to the sense of identity and the lack of interest on mobility compared to those who are not borned in the UK.
Hence, the leave voters would prefer protective policies to their own country, to control their own borders and immigration, while making their own laws without being affected by the EU.

# Task 4: Animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade

[The London Fire Brigade](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb) attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call 'special services').
These 'special services' include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress.
The data is provided from January 2009 and is updated monthly.
A range of information is supplied for each incident including some location information (postcode, borough, ward), as well as the data/time of the incidents.
We do not routinely record data about animal deaths or injuries.

Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.

```{r load_animal_rescue_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/8a7d91c2-9aec-4bde-937a-3998f4717cd8/Animal%20Rescue%20incidents%20attended%20by%20LFB%20from%20Jan%202009.csv"

animal_rescue <- read_csv(url,
                          locale = locale(encoding = "CP1252")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()


glimpse(animal_rescue)
```

One of the more useful things one can do with any data set is quick counts, namely to see how many observations fall within one category.
For instance, if we wanted to count the number of incidents by year, we would either use `group_by()... summarise()` or, simply [`count()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html)

```{r, instances_by_calendar_year}

animal_rescue %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(cal_year) %>% 
  summarise(count=n())

animal_rescue %>% 
  count(cal_year, name="count")

```

Let us try to see how many incidents we have by animal group.
Again, we can do this either using group_by() and summarise(), or by using count()

```{r, animal_group_percentages}
animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  #group_by and summarise will produce a new column with the count in each animal group
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  
  # mutate adds a new column; here we calculate the percentage
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2)) %>% 
  
  # arrange() sorts the data by percent. Since the default sorting is min to max and we would like to see it sorted
  # in descending order (max to min), we use arrange(desc()) 
  arrange(desc(percent))


animal_rescue %>% 
  
  #count does the same thing as group_by and summarise
  # name = "count" will call the column with the counts "count" ( exciting, I know)
  # and 'sort=TRUE' will sort them from max to min
  count(animal_group_parent, name="count", sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2))


```

Do you see anything strange in these tables?
There are two cats data, cat and Cat with lower and upper case.

Finally, let us have a loot at the notional cost for rescuing each of these animals.
As the LFB says,

> Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.

There is two things we will do:

1.  Calculate the mean and median `incident_notional_cost` for each `animal_group_parent`
2.  Plot a boxplot to get a feel for the distribution of `incident_notional_cost` by `animal_group_parent`.

Before we go on, however, we need to fix `incident_notional_cost` as it is stored as a `chr`, or character, rather than a number.

```{r, parse_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# what type is variable incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue`
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

# readr::parse_number() will convert any numerical values stored as characters into numbers
animal_rescue <- animal_rescue %>% 

  # we use mutate() to use the parse_number() function and overwrite the same variable
  mutate(incident_notional_cost = parse_number(incident_notional_cost))

# incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue` is now 'double' or numeric
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

```

Now that incident_notional_cost is numeric, let us quickly calculate summary statistics for each animal group.

```{r, stats_on_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

animal_rescue %>% 
  
  # group by animal_group_parent
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  # filter resulting data, so each group has at least 6 observations
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  
  # summarise() will collapse all values into 3 values: the mean, median, and count  
  # we use na.rm=TRUE to make sure we remove any NAs, or cases where we do not have the incident cos
  summarise(mean_incident_cost = mean (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_incident_cost = median (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_incident_cost = sd (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_incident_cost = min (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_incident_cost = max (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>% 
  
  # sort the resulting data in descending order. You choose whether to sort by count or mean cost.
  arrange(desc(count))

```

Compare the mean and the median for each animal group.
what do you think this is telling us?
In general, mean is larger than median for each animal group.
The distribution is right skewed.
Showing that the costs decreases with more animal rescued.
Anything else that stands out?
Any outliers?
The mean and median costs of Horse and Cow stands out with nearly twice the cost than other animal groups.
We can consider them as outliers.

Finally, let us plot a few plots that show the distribution of incident_cost for each animal group.

```{r, plots_on_incident_cost_by_animal_group,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# base_plot
base_plot <- animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=incident_notional_cost))+
  facet_wrap(~animal_group_parent, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()

base_plot + geom_histogram()
base_plot + geom_density()
base_plot + geom_boxplot()
base_plot + stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)



```

Which of these four graphs do you think best communicates the variability of the `incident_notional_cost` values?
Also, can you please tell some sort of story (which animals are more expensive to rescue than others, the spread of values) and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

From my observation, seems like only three graphs best communicates the variability of the `incident_notional_cost` values: Cow, Ferret, Rabbit.
The counts, density, box-plot, and ecdf displayed the higher spread of costs.
While other animal groups costs lowers drastically with higher rescue counts when passing a threshold.
This might be due to limited resources for cow, ferret, and rabbit rescue.
Resources could be labour, specialized knowledge and any equipments available.

title: Omega Group plc - Pay Discrimination
---

<script src="/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js"></script>


<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using <code>t.test()</code> and with the simulation method from the <code>infer</code> package.</p>

<p>Though the infer package returns a 0 p_value, it is impossible to have a p value of 0. Infer package sometimes returns p_values of 0 when the p-value is very small. When running the t-test, we got a p-value of 2e-04 which is very low and it confirms our hypothesis that inferpackage rounded down the p-value to 0. In conclusion the null hypothesis is rejected and that there is a difference between the salaries of men and women.</p>

<h2>Relationship Experience - Gender?</h2>
<p>At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Summary Statistics of salary by gender

Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Women have a lot less experience and less salary and females have a stronger correlation between their experience and salary than males. Whereas males have more experience but there is less correlation between salary and experience.
It is interesting that women do not work in the company as long. We could look into why women have less experience at the company. Is it because they are having kids? or is it because they are not being promoted to management roles because they are women?</p>

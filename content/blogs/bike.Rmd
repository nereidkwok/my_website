Download the latest TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day.

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



Facet grid plots of bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/tfl_distributions_monthly.png", error = FALSE)
```

> May and Jun in 2020 are significantly different compared to the previous years. This might be due to COVID, under which most people tend to transit less away from home, and employees usually work from home rather than to work at office.

Below 2 graphs showcase the difference between the expected number of rentals per week/month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals. 

Mean rather than median will be used to calculate your expected rentals, since we would like the whole picture of the specific week or month.


Graph of monthly change in Tfl bike rentals, displaying changes from monthly average shown in Blue and calculated between 2016-2019.

  group_by(month)%>%
  summarise(expected_avg = mean(bikes_hired))

# Filter all data after 2016

  filter(day >= dmy("01/01/2016"))%>%
  # Actual monthly average for the months
  group_by(year,month) %>%

## Nereid Kwok Short Biography

Hello, my name is **Nereid**. I am a Master of Analytics and Management student at London Business School.

I am from Hong Kong where I got my bachelor degree in Quantitative Finance.

Over my undergraduate studies, I have interned at several financial services companies, NGOs, and investment banks.

After graduation I worked at Goldman Sachs for a year in the Finance division before my studies at LBS.

I only had intermediate knowledge on programming in R, VBA, Python, and SQL. I wish to learn more on analytics through the MAM program.

Here are some of my hobbies that I enjoy during my leisure time:

-   Water sports over the summer (canoeing, snorkeling)
-   Hiking around fall and spring
-   Playing Sudoku if I am absolutely bored
-   Explore all kinds of food

This is one of my best dessert finds in Hong Kong: ![Shari Shari Kakigori](https://magazine.foodpanda.hk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/Shari-Shari-Kakigori.jpg)
